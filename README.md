# 🎨 AI Art Style Detector (Flutter APP)

**AI Art Style Detector** is a minimalist Flutter application that simulates detecting the art style of an uploaded painting. 
Users can select an image from their device and receive a randomly chosen style like "Impressionism", 
"Cubism", or "Realism" — all processed offline with a clean UI.
